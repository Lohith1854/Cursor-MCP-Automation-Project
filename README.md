# Cursor-MCP Automation Project
During this project, I explored the fundamentals of MCP and learned to integrate AI with real-world tools like Cursor IDE, Pipedream, and MCP Servers. One of the highlights of this journey was gaining hands-on experience in building prompt-driven AI workflows, which gave me a deeper understanding of how AI can be applied to solve practical problems.
